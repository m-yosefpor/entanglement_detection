Entanglement is one of the key resources of quantum information science which makes identification of entangled states essential to a wide range of quantum technologies and phenomena.
This problem is however both computationally and experimentally challenging.
Here we use autoencoder neural networks to find semi-optimal measurements for detection of entangled states. We show that it is possible to find high-performance entanglement detectors with as few as three measurements. Also, with the complete information of the state, we develop a neural network that can identify all two-qubits entangled states almost perfectly.
This result paves the way for automatic development of efficient entanglement witnesses  and  entanglement detection using machine learning techniques.
